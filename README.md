# Exercism JavaScript Exercises

<p>
  I have found Exercism to be an excellent place for developers to learn or practice their skills.
  The site has a very simple and straight-forward approach, and plenty of resources if you need help.
<br />
  File names are the same as the exercises.
<br />
  Removed exports and the commented sections from Exercism.
